The descriptions, requirements, and controlled lists are based on the Clinicaltrials.gov Data Elements (https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/definitions.html) and extended with the ClinicalTrials.gov XML schema descriptor (https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/ProtocolRecordSchema.xsd) when necessary. Character limits have been removed unless otherwise specified. Note that the 'BriefTitle', 'OutcomesModule', 'IPDSharingStatementModule', and 'ReferencesModule' properties from ClinicalTrials.gov are not included as they were not deemed relevant for the use case in the CDS. Some keys, values in controlled lists, etc. are from the the ECRIN Metadata Schema for study v6.0. We have also introduced some modifications as necessary for tailoring the schema to clinical research datasets. All keys are camelCase.",
