  - code_name: ekg
    datatype_description: 
      description_text: Recording of the moment-to-moment electromotive forces of the heart as projected onto various sites on the body's surface, delineated as a scalar function of time. The recording is monitored by a tracing on slow moving chart paper or by observing it on a cardioscope, which is a cathode ray tube display.
